# wiiBotPi
wiiBot project changed to utilize a raspberry pi
for now the only thing in the repository will be the robot code. Later the
configuration files for the raspberry pi will be added as well. Possibly a
whole image of the raspberry pi OS.

Note: The dates for commit times are messed up because they were commited from a raspberry pi whose date/time hadn't been properly configured.
